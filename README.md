Question 2 - Argue Selection Sort Correctness

The array is sorting unsorted arrays and returning sorted arrays. The algorithm is doing what it is intended to do which can be seen in the outputs. An example is also included in the code for the user to see the behavior of the Selection Sort algorithm.  



Question 3 - Benchmark the runtime of each algorithm

The benchmarks of each algorithm should be displayed once each of the python file in this repository is run. Run the files through the command line in this format "python filename.py". Once each file is run, the output display the times the algorithm takes for varying input sizes from 5 to 5000. A graph of size vs time for each algorithm is also displayed. Each array is run 3 times to get the benchmark readings. Below is the system information in which the algorithms were benchmarked on.
